# binb #

binb is a simple, realtime, multiplayer, competitive music listening game.

To play the game: [http://binb.nodejitsu.com](http://binb.nodejitsu.com) 

## Browser compatibiliy ##

Ideal setup is a browser with websocket support and able to decode .m4a format natively. 

For this reason binb is optimized for Google Chrome but also works in all major browsers (if version is recently enough).
